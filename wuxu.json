      "subtitle": "The universal TrollStore installer for iOS 14.0 - 17.0.0.0 beta 4",
      "localizedDescription": "Overview\n\nTrollInstallerX is a universal TrollStore installer. It focuses on being extremely reliable and easy to use. It is also very fast, being able to install TrollStore and/or its persistence helper in a matter of seconds on the latest devices.\n\nTrollInstallerX supports all devices running iOS 14.0 - 16.6.1, both arm64 and arm64e. It makes use of one of two different methods to install TrollStore, depending on what device and iOS you have. These methods are:\n\n• Direct installation: using the kfd kernel exploit, along with the dmaFail PPL bypass on iOS 15.2+ arm64e devices, TrollInstallerX can install both TrollStore and its persistence helper directly onto the device without having to leave the installer.\n\n   - Supports iOS 14.0 - 16.6.1 (arm64) and iOS 14.0 - 16.5.1 (arm64e).\n      • Note: A15, A16, and M2 devices on iOS 16.5.1 do not support this method.\n      • Note: A8 devices are only supported on iOS 14.0 - 15.1 for the time being.\n• Indirect installation: Using the kfd kernel exploit, TrollInstallerX can replace a system application of your choice with the TrollStore persistence helper. This method only exists due to both the lack of a PPL bypass on iOS 16.6 and above, as well as the fact that dmaFail is non-functional on A15, A16, and M2 devices on iOS 16.5.1.\n\n   - Supports iOS 16.5.1 - 16.6.1 (arm64e).\n      • Note: This method is the only method that supports A15, A16, and M2 devices on iOS 16.5.1.\n\nBoth methods allow you to install a persistence helper into a removable system app. The reason that this is needed is due to the way that the CoreTrust bug (used by TrollStore) works - in certain circumstances, TrollStore and other apps installed by it will be reset to User registration, instead of System. You cannot open any of these apps until you have used the persistence helper to set them back to System registration.\n\n\nUsage\n\nTrollInstallerX is extremely easy to use. Simply download the latest release from the Releases page, and sideload it using your preferred method. Once installed, open the app and press the \"Install\" button. From there, TrollStore and/or its persistence helper will be installed onto your device.\n\nTrollInstallerX will automatically choose the best exploit for your device. However, in some cases, you may want to choose a specific exploit. To do this, simply open the settings view and select the exploit that you want to use. Once you have selected it, press the \"Install TrollStore\" button and TrollInstallerX will use the exploit you have chosen.\n\nNote: iOS 16.2 - 16.6.1 and iOS 15.7.2 - 15.8.2 require an internet connection in order for TrollInstallerX to download the kernelcache and patchfind it.",

      "localizedDescription": "PPSSPP is the best and only PSP emulator for iOS written in C++. It is capable of running a lot of original games but, depending on the power of your device, not all may run at full speed due to restrictions on non-jailbroken devices.\n\nThe app was originally created by Henrik Rydgård in November 2012; however, iOS builds are mostly managed by talented developer, Karen Tsai (aka @angelxwind) and a large group of contributors that submit issue reports and fixes. Several versions of PPSSPP can be played on numerous devices such as Android, Windows, Mac, Linux and Blackberry 10. The iOS version can be found on both Jailbreak and non-Jailbreak devices.\n\nPPSSPP supports all versions of iPad, iPhone, iPod touch running iOS 5 and above; this includes iPhone 5 and other retina-enabled devices. The emulator does not require bios to play, PPSSPP is - in many ways - a “HLE” emulator. PPSSPP requires ROM images, specifically .ISO or .CSO files, to play. No ROMs are included in this copy of the emulator. If you own any games, add them through iTunes Sharing or other programs like 'iExplorer.' Keep in mind these files are extremely big, sometimes taking several gigs in size.\n\nThe emulator is built to use JIT decompilers (dynarecs) which can only be accessed on a jailbroken device due to the codesigining requirement. Therefore, most games will run very slow on non-jailbroken devices; however, there are a few older PSP games that will run just fine and up to speed depending on your iOS device.",

Our goal getting into Scarlet is to give everybody access to a store that doesn't tell people to do the workarounds. Instead, we created an app with every user in mind to bring a smooth experience.\n\n\nTrue repo system\n\nScarlet offers the first ever true repo system for all users.\nWhat is a true repo system ? - Our repo system supports jailbreak repos and jailed users can make use of some features added to the side.\nThese include 1. Force install jailbroken apps while jailed\n2. Automatically/Manually injects the tweak into the app it's meant for(no jailbreak required)\n\nWe include native repos specifically designed for Scarlet. Developers have the ability to choose a dylibs/debs to inject into the specificed app.\n \n\nMade by Pros\n\nScarlet's GUI was designed by Xeviks.\nHe has brought color, vibrancy, movement, and modernity - yet keeping the look simplistic.\nDebianArch is the solo-dev of the Scarlet app and is bringing innovative features to reshape the community that was left unchanged.
