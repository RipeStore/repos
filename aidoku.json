Note that this can increase the time it takes for images to load, especially for slower/older devices, and is still very much an experimental feature.\n• Keyboard support: use a connected keyboard (or if you’re just using macOS) to turn pages.\n• Custom series covers: select from alternate covers if a source provides them, or upload your own cover images.\n• Rewritten History tab: it should hopefully look pretty much the same… but be a bit less buggy! The excessive stuttering, long loading times, and needless reloading in some cases were fixed.\n• Other features and fixes:\n    • Manual page image reload option (if a page loads incorrectly)\n    • Uploading local files should actually work now\n    • Tracker searching now has a toggle•able filter for NSFW results\n    • …and more!",
