          "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU v9.1.2** The backend has been updated to the latest upstream QEMU which brings with it a variety of bug fixes and performance improvements.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Nested virtualization for Linux** Linux VMs using Apple Virtualization backend on macOS 15 and M3 or newer will now have nested virtualization enabled by default.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Total Store Ordering for QEMU** VMs using QEMU backend on macOS 15 can now enable TSO (in QEMU settings) at the hypervisor level. When TSO is enabled on a guest operating system that is aware of the system register (i.e. Rosetta for Linux), performance of Intel emulation within the guest can be greatly improved. Note that if the guest kernel supports dynamically toggling TSO, you do not need to enable this.\r\n* (macOS 15) **Improved macOS guest support** The last window size (including full screen size) will be restored when the guest supports dynamic resolution. Removable drives and shared directories can now be ejected and changed while the macOS VM is running. Copy/paste synchronization between macOS 15 guest and host now works when the guest tools are installed (from the CD icon in the toolbar).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue with macOS 15.0 and 15.0.1 where accesses to files will fail due to a permission error. This issue has been resolved with macOS 15.1.\r\n* (macOS) There is a known issue on M4 series of Macs where virtualization fails for macOS guests older than 13.4. The issue has been resolved with macOS 15.2.\r\n* The default CPU for x86_64 emulation and virtualization will now try to match the architecture of your system or the highest architecture that QEMU supports. For example, a 2016 MacBook Pro or newer will now emulate a \"Skylake\" based processor instead of a generic x86_64 processor. This should improve compatibility and performance of newer operating systems but may cause issues with older operating systems. If you run into issues, you can manually change the CPU model to an older one in the VM's System settings.\r\n* v4.6.5 reverted a change from v4.6.4 due to reports of crashes and kernel panics on some machines. As a result, there will be issues when upgrading to Windows 11 24H2 where the screen will go black. An alternative fix with an updated driver will be provided as soon as possible, but for now if you plan to upgrade to Windows 11 24H2, it is recommended you do it from v4.6.4 before updating UTM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.6.5)\r\n* Reverted virtio-ramfb changes from v4.6.4 due to some users experiencing crashes and kernel panics. An alternative fix to the black screen issue will come in a Windows Guest Support driver update in the future. Until that is released, issue #6332 and #6883 will be unfixed. (#6919)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* Localization: Updated Korean (thanks @somnisomni)\r\n* (iOS Remote) Show an error message when Local Network Access is not granted and support retry scanning on failure\r\n* (iOS Remote) Fix hang when QEMU terminates early\r\n* (iOS Remote) Fix crash on iOS 14 (#7034) (thanks @tearsinthegame)\r\n* (iOS Remote) Fix error starting VMs with pcspeaker\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: added icon, display, and registry configuration options (thanks @naveenrajm7)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the cursor might be captured while a modal is presented, making closing the modal impossible (#6960, #7092)\r\n* (macOS) VM Config: Improved layout of the Apple VM shared directory page (#6712)\r\n* (macOS) When toggling a shared directory from read-only -> read-write, UTM will crash if the change fails. Now, the option will be disabled if it is known to fail. (#7001)\r\n* (macOS) Settings: New option to handle first click in QEMU VMs even if the window is in the background (#7098)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fix utmctl not detecting the application bundle path if UTM.app was renamed (#7094)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.6.4)\r\n* ~~Fixed an issue with virtio-ramfb device where Windows may sometimes try to render to an inactive display target causing black screen, \"Guest has not initialized the display (yet)\", or broken cursor. This sometimes happens right after installing the viogpudo drivers for the first time and more recently while upgrading to Windows 11 24H2.
